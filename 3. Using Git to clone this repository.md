# Installing Essential Developer Tools

## System Update
As soon as the system first boots up, update all the system software with the followings:
```
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Install Git
Git is a tool to manage software repository (either locally or on Github).
Download this tool so we can download some of the scripts and pre-configued config files to speed up the set up of this Pi as a Developer Pi.
```
  sudo apt install git -y
```

*If possible, use the Github Personal Authorisation Token in place of password.*
