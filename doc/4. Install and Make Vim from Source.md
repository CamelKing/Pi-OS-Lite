# Install Vim 9.0 from Source

*Update October 2023 - Raspberry Pi OS updated to Debian Bookworm, and vim from apt install is now version 9.*

Pi OS does not come with Vim installed. Either that, or it comes with an outdated version 8.2.

If try to install using 

```
sudo apt install vim
```

only version 8.2 will be installed (as of 2023 Oct).

As such, to install version 9.0 (or latest), do the followings:


1. Download the source and make vim.

```
    git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
    cd vim/src
    make
    make test
    make install
    vim
```


2. If error message during make/make test:

```
    checking for tgetent()... configure: error: NOT FOUND!
    You need to install a terminal library; for example ncurses.
    On Linux that would be the libncurses-dev package.
    Or specify the name of the library with --with-tlib.
```

   then install ncurses library and libtool by:

```
    sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
    sudo apt install libtool libtool-bin
```

3. Vim can be found in

```
    /usr/local/bin/vim
```

4. The entire git source code cloned can be removed once Vim is made.
```
    rm rf <directories where vim sourced were cloned>
```
